Notes:
Although I did my best, for some reason the program runs well only with maximum two processors, and I could not debug this issue. Anything more, and it enters a loop which ends either waiting for a short duration, or killing the program. Most of the ex files functioned perfectly till the third processor begins calculations. Therefore, totalWait, maxWait, and averageWait are also calculated correctly for the first two processors.
